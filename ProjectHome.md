This is a handy JS widget that shows your latest Readernaut reads. Please note that it is all but feature complete and provides just pure scripting and HTML but no CSS.

**How to use it:**

Just put this code where you want the widget to appear. You should exchange XXXX with your username, of course:

```
<div id="myreads" class="user-XXXX">
	<a href="http://readernaut.com/XXXX">My Reads</a>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://listreads.googlecode.com/files/listreads.js"></script> 
```
